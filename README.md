# Teacher Shortage Area Dashboard

The TSA dashboard was built using R Shiny and data from the U.S. Department of Education. The project addresses chronic teacher shortages in the U.S. by state, by content area, and over time. 

All data can be found at the following website: https://tsa.ed.gov/#/home/

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

### Prerequisites

You will need R and R Studio to build the app. I used STATA to transform the raw data from the USDOE, but you can use your preferred file format as long as you change the data read-in code. 


## Deployment

To deploy the app outside of R Studio, you can host the app using Shinyapps.io. Directions for deploying shiny apps are found here: https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/getting-started.html#deploying-applications
